# Expense-Tracking-App

# Python app that allows you to track and categorize your monthly expenses and help you budget. The app will let users type their expense category and amount directly into the terminal.The program then reads the file to summarize the expense totals for that month, while also summarizing how much you can spend for the rest of the month to stay in budget. Finally, It'll then save (append) that expense entry to a file.
